1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:21:38,000
[Speaker 1] The cultivation of ornamental plants broadly classifies into potted nursery plants and flowers which are used commercially and for ornamental purposes in the households.

2
00:25:28,000 --> 00:30:48,000
[Speaker 1] These are grown in various structures where we call it as the poly house, which is a protected structure, we call it as a protected cultivation.

3
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:21,118
[Speaker 1] And a smaller version of it is called the tunnel house, again, it is a poly house structure.

4
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:28,118
[Speaker 1] And the third one is called the shade net, which is nothing but a net protecting the insects with a lot of ventilation for air flow and sunlight.

5
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:30,188
[Speaker 1] And the fourth one is the open field cultivation.

6
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:31,988
[Speaker 1] We will see all these four in detail.

7
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:34,148
[Speaker 1] I will explain each one of them in detail.

8
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:36,428
[Speaker 1] So let's start with the poly house structures first.

9
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:40,788
[Speaker 1] Poly house structure is again called as I said is the high-tech cultivation method.

10
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:44,488
[Speaker 1] It is pretty expensive compared to all these four types of cultivation.

11
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:55,318
[Speaker 1] The government is funding for this type of poly house structures construction with subsidies from missions like NHB National Horticulture Board and NHM which is the National Horticulture Mission.

12
00:00:55,518 --> 00:01:02,388
[Speaker 1] A bit of difference also I will explain here, maybe it will be useful for you in getting in touch with touch based with the government for the subsidies.

13
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:07,988
[Speaker 1] NHB, it operates from the central and the loan processing happens in this way.

14
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:17,108
[Speaker 1] One will have to identify the land, will have to identify the crop, prepare a project report, present it to the bank, the funding bank, and then get an approval from the bank.

15
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:24,988
[Speaker 1] Later, fill up a form with the National Horticulture Board, submit it stating the same report that this is the project that we are going to take it.

16
00:01:25,238 --> 00:01:35,118
[Speaker 1] We will submit those documents to the government explaining that this is the project report and this is the projected income out of the project and the government approves with a work order.

17
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:49,788
[Speaker 1] Once that work order is done, the bank receives that work order letter and within a period of a month's time, a 50% subsidy of the amount is funded back into the loan account and thereby the expenses what you have incurred by taking up the loan goes down by 50%.

18
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:51,188
[Speaker 1] This is the back end model.

19
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:59,588
[Speaker 1] The other model is we will have to keep on paying the principal loan amount up till the principal loan amount is equal to the 50% subsidy.
