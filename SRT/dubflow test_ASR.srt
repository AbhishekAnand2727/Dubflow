00:00:00,483 --> 00:00:09,013
[Speaker 1] So, there was always a fascination for the human beings to see how the world looks from above.

2
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:12,613
[Speaker 1] It's almost like a heaven's point of view or a bird's point of view.

3
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:21,413
[Speaker 1] And to photograph from the above was a very challenging and difficult thing that was happening very rarely.

4
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:36,083
[Speaker 1] We have to hire a helicopter with a pilot who will have to drive you around the city and there is also the permission to fly the helicopter and then you have to have your whole crew and the camera loaded with the film to get a basic aerial view shot.

00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:40,883
[Speaker 1] But that changed forever with the advent of drone.

00:00:41,713 --> 00:01:05,283
[Speaker 1] Drones are a technological marvel which are smaller ones which can be operated remotely from the ground and it can fly up to 120 m and can capture beautiful cityscapes, aerial views which were only possible with big production houses or people who has had the luxury to fund for it.

00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:14,213
[Speaker 1] But let's see how drone operation can be used as a means for career and what are the things that you can do with a drone.

8
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:22,813
[Speaker 1] My friend Lokesh will explain you about the technicalities of the drone and how he made a living out of it.
